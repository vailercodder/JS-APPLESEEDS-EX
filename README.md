# JS-APPLESEEDS-EX

## Introduction

This repository contains a series of JavaScript exercises that I have completed to enhance my programming skills and understanding of JavaScript. These exercises cover various aspects of JavaScript from basic syntax to more advanced topics like asynchronous programming and web APIs.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `basics/` - Basic syntax and operations
- `functions/` - Function definitions and expressions
- `asynchronous/` - Exercises on asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
## How to Use

To run these exercises, you will need:

- A modern web browser that supports JavaScript
- A local server if you're running files that perform AJAX requests (to avoid CORS policies)

### Running an Exercise

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the subfolder containing the exercise you want to run.
